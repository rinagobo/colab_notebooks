# colab_notebooks
Data analysis projects using python and data vidualization labraries such as Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

1. Extracted insights from data on deaths by police in the United States
2. Extracted insights from data on trip data of a bike share service

### Data Analysis Steps:
**Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Visualize, Share, Act**

I mainly focused on Process, Analyze and Visualize steps.
